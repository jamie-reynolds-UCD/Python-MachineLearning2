# Python-MachineLearning2

The objective of this assignment was to explore how missing values can be handled in supervised machine learning. Two strategies were be explored, (1) consider missing values explicitly in the classification algorithm (Gaussian Naive Bayes) (2) use imputation methods to guess missing values.

The Naive Bayes Classifier I implemented in the Python-MachineLearning repository was the one used in this assignment.

My implementation using missing values and imputation is in the "Assignment2_COMP47750.ipynb" file.

The full assignment instructions can be found in the "Ass2 Missing Values 2021.pdf" file.
